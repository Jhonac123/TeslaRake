## Usage

After installation, you can start using TeslaRake to harvest energy efficiently. Here are some basic commands and features you can utilize:

- **Monitor Energy Production**: Use the built-in monitoring features to keep track of how much energy you are generating.
- **Adjust Settings**: Modify settings based on your environment and energy needs.
- **Data Logging**: Collect data for analysis and optimization of your energy harvesting methods.

### Example Code Snippet

```cpp
#include <TeslaRake.h>

void setup() {
  // Initialize TeslaRake
  TeslaRake.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // Monitor energy production
  float energy = TeslaRake.getEnergy();
  Serial.println("Energy produced: " + String(energy) + " Wh");
  delay(1000);
}
```
